 Image-based ML approaches for DAS data

This repository contains the work for Task 3.2.3: Image-based Machine Learning Approaches for Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), part of the Transform² project at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP).

The goal is to develop and test computer vision methods for automatic detection of seismic events in DAS data, enabling smart data selection and storage optimization.

The workflow builds on the open-source Julia package DASVader.jl, extending it with image-based ML capabilities.

This work is led by Mariano Arnaiz and Claudio Satriano (IPGP).
